### Can we use a database? What for? SQL or NoSQL?
Yes, we can use database in our application. 
We can use database for storing and managing the user gists as well as saving the file content of each gist corresponding to different users.
This approach will specifically save the GitHub http calls we need to make in case if the api request comes for same user multiple times with different or same pattern
. It will help to improve overall response time of search API.

As the GitHub gists are well-structured and contains a lot of fields. we can prefer SQL database. It will allow us to maintain relation between various fields as well as it will be helpful to write complex queries.

If we want to prefer only search API and focus on file content, we can go with NoSQL Database.
It will allow us to search efficiently in the database.

### How can we protect the api from abusing it?
To protect the APi from abusing, we can take several measures like 
1. Security measure like user authentication and authorisation
2. Proper Input Validation to avoid any attacks and misuse
3. Rate limiting to avoid any misuse which can cause server overload
4. CORS policy to avoid in secure requests

### How can we deploy the application in a cloud environment?
We can deploy the application using docker, kubernetes and a good cloud environment like Google cloud
1. First use docker build to generate docker image of our application
2. Tag the image and Push it to the docker registry
3. Create kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud platform
4. use kubernetes to deploy our application
5. we can use istio to implement rate limiting
6. 
### How can we be sure the application is alive and works as expected when deployed into a cloud environment?
1. We can devlop CI/CD jenkins pipeline, which can deploy our application with latest version
and run various tests like automation tests, unit tests, end-to-end tests, integration tests to ensure application works as expected
2. We can implement logging in the application to log various events, errors, and application health status
3. We can develop separate endpoints which can return application health status and metrics

### Any other topics you may find interesting and/or important to cover
Yes. As it is simple application with one API, there is a lot of future scope for development and various features.
We can implement a good Authentication and authorisation mechanism to make our application secure.
During adding a lot of APIs, we can consider the microservice architecture to make application scalable as well as maintainable.
